# Cypress Demo Project – QA Test Practice

This is a simple Cypress automation demo project created to refresh and showcase my QA skills using JavaScript and Cypress.

It simulates a basic login flow with validations and redirection — ideal for testing form behavior and core test automation concepts.  
The HTML pages (`login.html` and `dashboard.html`) are local and serve as a mock frontend.
